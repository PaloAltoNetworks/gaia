## APIAuthorizationPolicy

An API Authorization Policy defines what kind of operations a user of a system
can do in a namespace. The operations can be any combination of GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE,PATCH or HEAD. By default, an API Authorization Policy will only give
permissions in the context of the current namespace but you can make it
propagate to all the child namespaces. It is also possible restrict permissions
to apply only on a particular subset of the apis by setting the target
identities.

### Example

```json
{
  "authorizedIdentities": [
    "@auth:role=namespace.editor"
  ],
  "authorizedNamespace": "/namespace",
  "name": "the name"
}
```

## Enforcer

An Enforcer Profile contains a configuration for a Enforcer. It contains various
parameters, like what network should not policeds, what processing units should
be ignored based on their tags and so on. It also contains more advanced
parameters to fine tune the Agent. A Enforcer will decide what profile to apply
using aEnforcer Profile Mapping Policy. This policy will decide according the
Enforcer's tags what profile to use. If an Enforcer tags are matching more than
a single policy, it will refuse to start. Some parameters will be applied
directly to a running agent, some will need to restart it.

### Example

```json
{
  "FQDN": "server1.domain.com",
  "name": "the name"
}
```

## ExternalNetwork

An External Network represents a random network or ip that is not managed by the

as address, and 1-65000 for the ports. You will need to use the External
Services tags to set some policies.

```json

## FileAccessPolicy

A File Access Policy allows Processing Units to access various folder and files.
It will use the tags of a File Path to know what is the path of the file or
folder to allow access to. You can allow the Processing Unit to have any
combination of read, write or execute.

When a Processing Unit is Docker container, then it will police the volumes
mount. executewon''t have any effect.

File path are not supported yet for standard Linux processes.

### Example

```json
{
  "name": "the name"
}
```

## Namespace

A Namespace represents the core organizational unit of the system. All objects
always exists in a single namespace. A Namespace can also have child namespaces.
They can be used to split the system into organizations, business units,
applications, services or any combination you like.

### Example

```json
{
  "name": "mynamespace"
}
```

## NamespaceMappingPolicy

A Namespace Mapping Policy defines in which namespace a Processing Unit should
be placed when it is created, based on its tags.

When an Aporeto Agent creates a new Processing Unit, the system will place it in
its own namespace if no matching Namespace Mapping Policy can be found. If one
match is found, then the Processing will be bumped down to the namespace
declared in the policy. If it finds in that child namespace another matching
Namespace Mapping Policy, then the Processing Unit will be bumped down again,
until it reach a namespace with no matching policies.

This is very useful to dispatch processes and containers into a particular
namespace, based on a lot of factor.

You can put in place a quarantine namespace that will grab all Processing Units
with too much vulnerabilities for instances.

### Example

```json
{
  "mappedNamespace": "/blue/namespace",
  "name": "the name",
  "subject": [
    [
      "color=blue"
    ]
  ]
}
```

## ProcessingUnit

A Processing Unit reprents anything that can compute. It can be a Docker
container, or a simple Unix process. They are created, updated and deleted by
the system as they come and go. You can only modify its tags.  Processing Units
use Network Access Policies to define which other Processing Units or External
Services they can communicate with and File Access Policies to define what File
Paths they can use.

```json
{
  "name": "the name",
  "type": "Docker"
}

A tag is a string in the form of "key=value" that can applied to all objects in
the system. They are used for policy resolution. Tags starting by a "$" are
derived from the property of an object (for instance an object with ID set to
xxx and a name set to "the name" will be tagged by default with "$name=the name"
and "$id=xxx"). Tags starting with an "@" have been generated by an external
system.
