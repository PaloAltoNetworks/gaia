  description: A tag is a string in the form of "key=value" that can applied to all
    objects in the system. They are used for policy resolution. Tags starting by a
    "$" are derived from the property of an object (for instance an object with ID
    set to xxx and a name set to "the name" will be tagged by default with "$name=the
    name" and "$id=xxx"). Tags starting with an "@" have been generated by an external
    system.
