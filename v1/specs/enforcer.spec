    An Enforcer Profile contains a configuration for a Enforcer. It contains various
    parameters, like what network should not policeds, what processing units should
    be ignored based on their tags and so on. It also contains more advanced
    parameters to fine tune the Agent. A Enforcer will decide what profile to apply
    using aEnforcer Profile Mapping Policy. This policy will decide according the
    Enforcer's tags what profile to use. If an Enforcer tags are matching more than
    a single policy, it will refuse to start. Some parameters will be applied
    directly to a running agent, some will need to restart it.
