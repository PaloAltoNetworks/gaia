attributes:
  v1:
  - name: action
    description: |-
      Defines the action to apply to a flow.

      - `Allow`: allows the defined traffic.
      - `Reject`: rejects the defined traffic; useful in conjunction with an allow all policy.
      - `Continue`: neither allows or rejects the traffic; useful for applying another property to the traffic, such as encryption.

    type: enum
    exposed: true
    allowed_choices:
    - Allow
    - Reject
    - Continue
    default_value: Allow
    orderable: true

  - name: applyPolicyMode
    description: |-
      Sets three different types of policies. `IncomingTraffic`: applies the policy to
      all
      processing units that match the `object` and allows them to *accept* connections
      from
      processing units or external networks that match the `subject`.
      `OutgoingTraffic`: applies
      the policy to all processing units that match the `subject` and allows them to
      *initiate*
      connections with processing units or external networks that match the `object`.
      `Bidirectional` (default): applies the policy to all processing units that match
      the `object`
      and allows them to *accept* connections from processing units that match the
      `subject`.
      Also applies the policy to all processing units that match the `subject` and
      allows them
      to *initiate* connections with processing units that match the `object`.
    type: enum

    - OutgoingTraffic

    description: If set the policy will be automatically deleted after the given time.
    type: time

    getter: true
    setter: true

  - name: logsEnabled
    description: |-
      If `true`, the relevant flows are logged and available from the Aporeto control
      plane.
      Under some advanced scenarios you may wish to set this to `false`, such as to
      save space or
      improve performance.
    type: boolean
    exposed: true
    orderable: true

  - name: object
    description: A tag or tag expression identifying the object of the policy.

  - name: observationEnabled
    description: If set to `true`, the flow will be in observation mode.
    type: boolean
    exposed: true
    orderable: true

  - name: observedTrafficAction
    description: |-
      If `observationEnabled` is set to `true`, this defines the final action taken
      on the packets: `Apply` or `Continue` (default).
    type: enum
