    through third party entities (such as a cloud provider) or through  processing
    units.

      use `MTLSCertificateAuthority`, otherwise Aporeto's public signing certificate

  - name: claimsToHTTPHeaderMappings
    description: |-
      Defines a list of mappings between claims and HTTP headers. When these mappings
      are defined,
      the enforcer will copy the values of the claims to the corresponding HTTP
      headers.
    type: refList
    exposed: true
    subtype: claimmapping
    stored: true
    extensions:
      refMode: pointer

      policy rendering.

    read_only: true
    extensions:

  - name: exposedAPIs
    description: |-
      Contains a tag expression that will determine which APIs a service is exposing.
      The APIs can be defined as the `RESTAPISpec` or similar specifications for other
      layer 7 protocols.
    type: external
    exposed: true
    subtype: '[][]string'
    stored: true
    example_value:
    - - package=p1
    validations:
    - $tagsExpression

  - name: exposedPort
    description: |-
      The port that the service can be accessed on. Note that this is different from
      the
      `port` attribute that describes the port that the service is actually listening
      on.
      For example if a load balancer is used, the `exposedPort` is the port that the
      load
      balancer is listening for the service, whereas the port that the implementation
      is
      listening can be different.
    type: integer
    exposed: true
    stored: true
    required: true
    example_value: 443
    max_value: 65535

  - name: exposedServiceIsTLS
    description: |-
      Indicates that the exposed service is TLS. This means that the enforcer has to
      initiate a
      TLS session in order to forward traffic to the service.
    type: boolean
    exposed: true
    stored: true
    default_value: false
    filterable: true
    orderable: true

  - name: external
    description: Indicates if this is an external service.
    type: boolean
    exposed: true
    stored: true

    orderable: true

  - name: hosts
    description: The host names that the service can be accessed on.
    type: list
    exposed: true
    subtype: string
    stored: true
    orderable: true

  - name: port
    description: |-
      The port that the implementation of the service is listening to. It can be
      different than
      `exposedPort`. This is needed for port mapping use cases where there are private
      and
      public ports.
    type: integer
    exposed: true
    stored: true
    required: true
    example_value: 443
    max_value: 65535

  - name: publicApplicationPort
    description: |-
      A new virtual port that the service can be accessed on, using HTTPS. Since the
      enforcer
      transparently inserts TLS in the application path, you might want to declare a
      new port
      where the enforcer listens for TLS. However, the application does not need to be
      modified
      and the enforcer will map the traffic to the correct application port. This
      useful when
      an application is being accessed from a public network.
    type: integer
    exposed: true
    stored: true
    example_value: 443
    max_value: 65535

  - name: redirectURLOnAuthorizationFailure
    description: |-
      If this is set, the user will be redirected to that URL in case of any
      authorization
      failure, allowing you to provide a nice message to the user. The query parameter
      `?failure_message=<message>` will be added to that URL explaining the possible
      reasons
      of the failure.
    type: string
    exposed: true
    stored: true

  - name: selectors
    description: |-
      A tag or tag expression that identifies the processing unit that implements this
      particular service.
    type: external
    exposed: true
    subtype: '[][]string'
    stored: true
    example_value:
    - - $identity=processingunit
    validations:
    - $tagsExpression

  - name: trustedCertificateAuthorities
    description: |-
      PEM-encoded certificate authorities to trust when additional hops are needed. It
      must be
      set if the service must reach a service marked as `external` or must go through
      an
      additional TLS termination point like a layer 7 load balancer.
    type: string
    exposed: true
