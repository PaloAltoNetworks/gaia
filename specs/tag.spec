    A tag is a string in the form of "key=value" that can applied to all objects in
    the system. They are used for policy resolution. Tags starting by a "$" are
    derived from the property of an object (for instance an object with ID set to
    xxx and a name set to "the name" will be tagged by default with "$name=the name"
    and "$id=xxx"). Tags starting with an "@" have been generated by an external
    system.
