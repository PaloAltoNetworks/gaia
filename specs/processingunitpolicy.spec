  description: |-
    Processing unit policies allow you to define special behavior for
    processing units. For example you can associate an isolation profile
    with a set of processing units or select a specific datapath.

# Attributes
attributes:
  v1:
  - name: action
    description: |-
      Action determines the action to take while enforcing the isolation profile.
      NOTE: Choose `Default` if your processing unit is not supposed to make a
      decision on isolation profiles at all.
    type: enum
    exposed: true
    stored: true
    allowed_choices:
    - Default
    - Delete
    - Enforce
    - LogCompliance
    - Reject
    - Snapshot
    - Stop
    default_value: Default
    orderable: true

  - name: datapathType
    description: |-
      The datapath type that processing units selected by `subject` should
      implement:
      - `Default`: This policy is not making a decision for the
      datapath.
      - `Aporeto`: The enforcer is managing and handling the datapath.
      - `EnvoyAuthorizer`: The enforcer is serving envoy compatible gRPC APIs
      for every processing unit that for example can be used by an envoy
      proxy to use the Aporeto PKI and implement Aporeto network access
      policies. NOTE: The enforcer is not going to own the datapath in this
      example. It is merely providing an authorizer API.
    type: enum
